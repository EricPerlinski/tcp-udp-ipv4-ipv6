In order to launch the project, you have to 
launch 1 or more instance of clientsand one 
instance of server. That's why you need 
multiple consoles. 

First, you need to compile the program and 
create all the differents directories.

To do so, type "make directories" in your unix 
console. 

Then, type "make" to compile. It'll generate
automatically the executable files in the 
appropriate directory named "bin".

You can run the server by launching the shell
script "./run_server.sh"

You can also run the client by launching the
shell script "./run_client.sh"


If you want to edit ports for the server,
you can just edit the shell script. There's no 
need to recompile. That's the same for the client, 
just edit the shell script with appropriate 
ip address and port.
